# AI-Driven Seasonal Churn Reduction for Niche ISPs

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project leverages AI to predict and mitigate seasonal customer churn for niche internet service providers. By analyzing granular usage patterns and customer demographics, the system generates personalized retention offers, maximizing customer lifetime value and stabilizing revenue during off-peak periods.

## Background

Niche internet service providers (ISPs) frequently experience significant customer churn due to seasonal fluctuations in internet usage. Customers whose primary need for connectivity aligns with peak seasons (e.g., summer for vacation homes, academic year for student housing) are prone to canceling subscriptions during the off-season, resulting in substantial revenue loss. This challenge is particularly pronounced for niche ISPs catering to specific seasonal demographics. While some ISPs offer basic off-season packages, their generic messaging and lack of targeted delivery often prove ineffective. This project is driven by the potential of AI to address this real-world business problem, empowering small ISPs to thrive in competitive markets.  It is crucial because it directly tackles a common pain point, offering the potential to significantly improve financial performance and business sustainability.

*   High churn rates during the off-season.
*   Ineffective, non-personalized retention strategies.
*   Loss of potential revenue and diminished customer lifetime value.

## How is it used?

The primary users are the ISP's marketing and customer support teams, who interact with the AI system through a user-friendly dashboard.  This dashboard provides insights into predicted churn risk and facilitates the creation and deployment of personalized retention offers.

1.  The ISP securely uploads historical customer data (usage metrics, demographics, billing information) to the cloud-based AI system.
2.  The system analyzes the data, trains churn prediction models, and validates their performance.
3.  The system identifies customers at high risk of churning during the upcoming off-season, providing a risk score for each customer.
4.  Based on individual usage patterns, customer profiles, and predicted risk, the system generates personalized retention offers, including discounted rates, service bundles, or "hibernation" options.
5.  The marketing team utilizes the dashboard to review, customize, and approve the AI-generated offers, ensuring alignment with overall marketing strategy.
6.  The customer support team leverages the dashboard to access personalized offers and proactively contact high-risk customers via preferred channels (email, SMS, phone).
7.  The system continuously monitors offer acceptance rates and customer behavior post-offer, using feedback loops to refine the models and optimize offer effectiveness.

The solution is designed for cloud deployment, ensuring scalability, accessibility, and ease of integration with existing ISP systems. Churn prediction and offer generation are typically performed monthly, prior to the start of the off-season, allowing for proactive intervention.

```python
# Example of a simplified churn prediction function (Illustrative - requires a trained ML model)
def predict_churn(usage_data, demographics):
    # In a real-world scenario, this would involve a trained ML model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
    # The function would take feature vectors derived from usage_data and demographics as input
    # and return a churn probability.
    if usage_data['peak_usage'] > 100 and usage_data['off_season_usage'] < 20:
        return 0.8  # 80% churn probability
    else:
        return 0.2

## Data sources and AI methods

Data will be sourced from the ISP's existing systems, including billing systems, CRM databases, and network logs.  Data will be collected and stored securely, complying with privacy regulations.

The project will use a combination of AI/ML techniques:

*   **Churn Prediction:** Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Logistic Regression models.
*   **Time Series Analysis:** ARIMA or Prophet models to analyze usage trends.
*   **Personalized Offers:** Rule-based systems initially, potentially moving to Reinforcement Learning for optimization.

Libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and potentially TensorFlow/PyTorch will be used.

## Challenges

This project faces several key challenges:

*   **Data Scope Limitations:** The current project focuses primarily on analyzing numerical data consumption records.  It does not currently incorporate analysis of the *content* accessed by users.
*   **Data Heterogeneity:** Input datasets will likely vary significantly across different ISPs in terms of format, data fields, and data quality.  Therefore, a robust and adaptable data preprocessing pipeline is essential.  This pipeline must be capable of handling missing data, inconsistent formatting, and varying data granularities.  Furthermore, the system needs to be designed with a high degree of modularity to accommodate these variations and facilitate easy integration with different ISP systems.
*   **Model Generalization:** While the goal is to create a generic solution applicable to multiple ISPs, ensuring that the trained models generalize well to unseen data from different ISPs is a significant challenge.  Techniques like cross-validation, regularization, and ensemble learning will be crucial to mitigate overfitting and improve model robustness.
*   **Ethical Considerations:**  The use of customer data for churn prediction and targeted marketing raises important ethical considerations.  Data privacy must be paramount.  The system must adhere to all relevant data privacy regulations and ensure that customer data is handled securely and transparently.  Furthermore, the AI models must be carefully evaluated for potential biases that could lead to discriminatory or unfair outcomes.
*   **Technical Integration:** Integrating the AI system with existing ISP infrastructure can be complex.  Challenges include data transfer, API compatibility, and ensuring seamless operation within the ISP's existing workflow.  A well-defined API and clear documentation are essential for successful integration.

## What's next?

The project has significant potential for future development:

*   **Real-time Churn Prediction:** Move towards real-time churn prediction by integrating the system with live data streams. This would allow for more timely interventions and personalized offers.
*   **Proactive Customer Support Integration:** Integrate the churn prediction system with customer support platforms to enable proactive intervention.  For example, if a customer's usage pattern indicates a high churn risk, the system could automatically trigger a customer service outreach.
*   **Personalized Upselling and Cross-selling:** Expand the system to generate personalized upselling and cross-selling offers based on customer usage patterns and predicted needs.
*   **A/B Testing and Optimization:** Implement A/B testing frameworks to continuously evaluate the effectiveness of different retention offers and optimize the offer generation process.
*   **Explainable AI (XAI):** Incorporate XAI techniques to make the churn prediction models more transparent and interpretable. This would increase trust in the system and allow for better understanding of the factors driving churn.
*   **Integration with CRM and Marketing Automation Platforms:** Seamless integration with CRM and marketing automation platforms would streamline the process of managing customer data, deploying personalized offers, and tracking campaign effectiveness.
